This application is an inventory tracker for shopkeepers in a popular paper and dice rpg.

Currently, it is in Minimal Viable Product status. Although it's fully functional, I will be adding more features.

-   create a modal dialogue box for deleting entries.

-   add notes to item listing

-   add routing

-   improve state management

-   add animation

-   add logging capabilities

-   connect the app to an api
